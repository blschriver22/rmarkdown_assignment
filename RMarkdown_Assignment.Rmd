## R Markdown Introduction

`rmarkdown` allows you to create documents directly from your R Code. Using `rmarkdown` you can document your analysis, share R code and results with colleagues and even publish a professional document for end users. A `rmarkdown` file can be converted to a number of different formats including HTML, PDF and Word.

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R works best when take advantage of multiple packages and R Markdown is no exception. `knitr` is a package worth exploring as it allows the R Markdown `rmarkdown` to be converted to different document types. `rmarkdown` takes advantage of this relationship and knowing more about Knitr will help make your rendered documents that much better.

`rmarkdown` is not without challenges. I found the list formatting especially tedious, you have to ge the spacing just right. The HTML and Word outputs behaved differently and it took a lot of research to figure out what worked best for both or to find a workaround.


## Data Review {.tabset}
### Babynames
The `babynames` data set is provided by the SSA and contains US baby names with at least 5 uses.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(babynames))

```
### Pharma
Fabricated data modeled to look like real pharmacy claim data


```{r table2, echo=FALSE}

```


## Key R Markdown Functions and Uses

As with any R package there are too many functions and interesting code to talk about them all. However, a few things that `rmarkdown` does caught our attention and those are the items we will be discussing.

1.    Formatting
      *   Text
      *   Word Template
1.    Chunks
1.    External R Code


### Formatting
#### Text

`rmarkdown` is at it's core a markup language that allows methods for creating documents with headers, images, links etc. 

Here are a few common formatting commands:

Who doesn't like lists?! Also, comes in the Ordered variety (see above) \
Bold and Italics are among numerous formatting offered in `rmarkdown` \

**Code Snippet**
```
*   Un-ordered list item
	 +   *Italic* 
	 +   **Bold** 
```
**Output**

*   Un-ordered list item
	 +   *Italic*
	 +   **Bold**
	    
-----

Wrapping text in backquote (`) will highlight the selection which is great for highlighting R code.

**Code Snippet**
```
This is the R code to find out more about the rmarkdown word_document function
`?rmarkdown::word_document\`

```
**Output**

This is the R code to find out more about the rmarkdown word_document function `?rmarkdown::word_document`

-----

Headers are important for any document and using the hashtag will create different headers

**Code Snippet**
```
###### Header 1
####### Header 2
```

**Output**

##### Header Example 1 {.unlisted .unnumbered}

###### Header Example 2 {.unlisted .unnumbered} 

-----

Linking to to websites or other documents is a great way to keep users informed and engaged.

```

**Output**

You can even insert mathematical equations to help illustrate your point:

**Code Snippet**
```
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$`
```

**Output**
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$

#### Word Template
`rmarkdown` is great for rendering to an HTML doc, but what about Word? Some of the markup tags work in Word , but most do not. Plus, what about all the great formatting functionality in Word? Well, with a little code in the YAML header we can have our `rmarkdown` rendered to a custom word template with the formatting already setup.

Adding this to the YAML header will tell `knitr` to use the pre-built template

```
output:
   word_document:
   reference_docx: RMarkdown_Template.docx
```

1.    First you need to generate a Word Document from an `rmarkdown` file. 
1.    Then open the word doc and expand the Style section in the Ribbon
1.    Save the template and reference with the code above

### Chunks
Chunks are one of the mainstays of `rmarkdown`



```{r baby plots1, include=FALSE}

g1 <- babynames %>%
  filter(name=="Nora") %$% 
  ggplot(., aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=sex), lwd=1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1", "dodgerblue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Nora")

g2 <- babynames %>%
  filter(name=="Shawn") %$% 
  ggplot(., aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=sex), lwd=1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1", "dodgerblue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Shawn")

g3 <- babynames %>%
  filter(name=="Randall") %$% 
  ggplot(., aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=sex), lwd=1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1", "dodgerblue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Randall")

g4 <- babynames %>%
  filter(name=="Frances") %$% 
  ggplot(., aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=sex), lwd=1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1", "dodgerblue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Frances")

```


```{r babynames, echo=FALSE}

grid.arrange(g1,g2,g3,g4,ncol=2)
  
```

### External R Code
`rmarkdown` can be picky when trying to cut and paste existing R code. If you have a complicated R script or even just want to insert a graph. You can use the `## @knitr <your variable>` syntax you can create chunks in an external R script and call that chunk within the `rmarkdown` chunk header.




```{r table1, echo=TRUE}


```


```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}

```
